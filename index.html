    <section id="about">
        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The inspiration for this project came from a personal experience. One day, I tried to get the weather forecast for my city, but I found that most websites were overly complicated and overloaded with unnecessary information. Instead of providing clear, concise details about the weather, they were cluttered with ads and hard-to-navigate interfaces. Frustrated by the lack of simplicity and efficiency, I decided to take matters into my own hands.<br>
        <br>
        Driven by the desire for a straightforward solution, I set out to create my own web app that makes accessing weather information easy and hassle-free. My goal was to design a simple, user-friendly interface that delivers all the essential weather details—current conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure—without any of the clutter.<br>
        <br>
        Through this project, I aim to offer a seamless experience for everyone who, like me, just wants quick and clear weather updates. This web app is the result of my commitment to making weather information easily accessible and user-friendly for all.</p>
